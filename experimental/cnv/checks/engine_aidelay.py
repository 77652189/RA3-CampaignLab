"""MaximumDelay-only pair on the successful aimicspon Hunt team.

Prediction before bench: zero permits both warriors to charge together; long
still permits the first charge, then samples a RUSH_ATTACK cooldown in 0..999s.
Thus long is expected to have no simultaneous pair in the automatic window,
but that is a sampled prediction, NOT a deterministic lower-bound guarantee.
Both builds keep MinimumDelay=0, no team delay, the same update/health/targets.
The old aimicmed all-zero run is not a successful delay control.
Only the automatic window is measured; remove the inherited manual warrior.
